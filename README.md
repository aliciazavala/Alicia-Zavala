# HackKU2020 - BWire
As group formed by international students, we are always making or receiving international money transfers,however, we noticed the need for a service to make this process faster and cheaper. The services currently offered around the world charge expensive fees and have a limited amount of currencies that can be exchanged in the process, reason why we decided to develop a web application that by using the technology offered by Xpring, would make this process faster, cheaper and open to exchange any currency.

# Demo
  Only fully working country is Bolivia
  
# What it does
By using html, CSS, and JavaScript, we built the front end of our web app, which allows the user to check their wallet balance, select a destination for the money transfer by continent and check the amount of XRP that can be purchased using their local currency.

# How we built it
After picking the idea for our project, one of our team members was dedicated to built the frontend of our web application using mostly html and CSS while the other two members were dedicated to building the backend using Javascript, Node.js library and the tools provided by Xpring.

# Challenges we ran into
Given that none of the members of our group had a strong background in web development or a lot of experience writing in JavaScript, the construction of our web application turned out to be quite challenging. By working together and communicating effectively, we were able to work around most of these challenges.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
despite the challenges we were presented with, we stayed together as a team, endured through the difficult times and proved to be resilient, consistent and in the end we persevered.

# What we learned
this experience allowed us to appreciate and understand the importance of key aspects for the development of web applications. Some of these aspects include teamwork, organization, communication, dedication, patience and others. We came into this project having little knowledge about web development but after an intense 36-hour hackathon that involved lots of research and code-writing, we leave with a feeling of satisfaction because we know that we gained important knowledge on a subject that is very important and widely used all around the world.

# What's next for Bwire
Our web application for the moment is basic, but with more time and resources invested into it and with the proper implementation of the systems provided by Ripple and Xpring, we believe that this app could be deployed successfully on a real-time environment.
